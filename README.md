# WEEKLY-ANALYSIS


This project involves analyzing weekly data using the ISLP (Introduction to Statistical Learning in Python) package. The main aim was to understand patterns and trends in the dataset and predict market direction based on previous weeks’ data. The analysis included data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis to identify relationships between variables like lag values, trading volume, and returns. Different classification models such as Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, and KNN were applied to predict outcomes. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix to find the best model. This project helped in understanding statistical learning concepts and applying machine learning techniques using Python.
